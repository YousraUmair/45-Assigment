//Your Own Array: Think of your favorite mode of transportation, such as a motorcycle or a car, and make a list that stores several examples. Use your list to print a series of statements about these items, such as â€œI would like to own a Honda motorcycle[] = ["honda Motercycle","honda City","honda civics","BMW"]

let transportation:string[] = ["Honda motercycle","Honda city","Honda civics","BMW"]

transportation.map((item)=> console.log("I would like to Own A",item));
