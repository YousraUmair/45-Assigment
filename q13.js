//Your Own Array: Think of your favorite mode of transportation, such as a motorcycle or a car, and make a list that stores several examples. Use your list to print a series of statements about these items, such as â€œI would like to own a Honda motorcycle[] = ["honda Motercycle","honda City","honda civics","BMW"]
var transportation = ["Honda motercycle", "Honda city", "Honda civics", "BMW"];
transportation.map(function (item) { return console.log("I would like to Own A", item); });
